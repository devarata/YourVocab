# YourVocab
This program scraps meaning of the word, its synonyms and usage of that word in a sentence and appends it to an excel.
It is most helpful for people building their vocabulary for GRE or in general.
I uploaded that excel on OneDrive so that I am able to access the excel anywhere, anytime.
